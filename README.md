# faithful-questions

Report:


	Over the past semester, I’ve been working on building a website that serves as a resource for Latter-day Saints who have questions about their faith. Dubbed “Faithful Questions,” my website (listed above) was a bit of a passion project and an opportunity for me to put into practice some of the newest things I’ve learned from my classes as a sophomore majoring in computer science. The website essentially uses Google’s Gemini AI to provide users with relevant scriptures, talks, and BYU speeches based on the questions, doubts, concerns, or inquiries they may have about our faith. It’s a full-stack application that uses React, Node.js, and AI integration hosted serverless through Vercel.

  
	Creating the app was both intellectually enlarging for me, as I was able to hone in my web development skills some more, as well as spiritually strengthening, as I was actually able to ask it some of the harder-hitting questions I’ve had on my mind recently and gather some useful resources for my personal scripture study. I hope that with my chosen career path, I can create things that make people's lives better and, if possible, bring them closer to Christ. Making this website was eye-opening, as it was the first time I’ve seen that hope realized. It doesn’t just feel like a dream anymore, but rather something of a path I’m really starting to embark on.

  
	FYI: It won’t work if your question is too specific as Gemini won’t be able to find enough resources to display, so ask more broad questions
